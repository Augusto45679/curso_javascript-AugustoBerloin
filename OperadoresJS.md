# JavaScript Operators

JavaScript supports a wide range of operators that can be used for various operations such as arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, and more. Here is a list of all the operators in JavaScript:

## 1. **Arithmetic Operators**
- `+` (Addition)
- `-` (Subtraction)
- `*` (Multiplication)
- `/` (Division)
- `%` (Modulus - returns the remainder of a division)
- `**` (Exponentiation - raises the first operand to the power of the second operand)
- `++` (Increment - increases the value by 1)
- `--` (Decrement - decreases the value by 1)

## 2. **Assignment Operators**
- `=` (Assignment)
- `+=` (Addition assignment)
- `-=` (Subtraction assignment)
- `*=` (Multiplication assignment)
- `/=` (Division assignment)
- `%=` (Modulus assignment)
- `**=` (Exponentiation assignment)
- `<<=` (Left shift assignment)
- `>>=` (Right shift assignment)
- `>>>=` (Unsigned right shift assignment)
- `&=` (Bitwise AND assignment)
- `|=` (Bitwise OR assignment)
- `^=` (Bitwise XOR assignment)

## 3. **Comparison Operators**
- `==` (Equal to)
- `===` (Strict equal to)
- `!=` (Not equal to)
- `!==` (Strict not equal to)
- `>` (Greater than)
- `<` (Less than)
- `>=` (Greater than or equal to)
- `<=` (Less than or equal to)

## 4. **Logical Operators**
- `&&` (Logical AND)
- `||` (Logical OR)
- `!` (Logical NOT)

## 5. **Bitwise Operators**
- `&` (Bitwise AND)
- `|` (Bitwise OR)
- `^` (Bitwise XOR)
- `~` (Bitwise NOT)
- `<<` (Left shift)
- `>>` (Right shift)
- `>>>` (Unsigned right shift)

## 6. **String Operators**
- `+` (Concatenation)
- `+=` (Concatenation assignment)

## 7. **Conditional (Ternary) Operator**
- `? :` (Conditional operator)

## 8. **Comma Operator**
- `,` (Comma operator)

## 9. **Unary Operators**
- `+` (Unary plus - converts its operand to a number)
- `-` (Unary negation - converts its operand to a number and negates it)
- `++` (Increment)
- `--` (Decrement)
- `typeof` (Returns the type of a variable)
- `delete` (Deletes a property from an object)
- `void` (Discards the expression's return value)
- `in` (Checks if a property exists in an object)
- `instanceof` (Checks if an object is an instance of a constructor)

## 10. **Relational Operators**
- `in` (Checks if a property exists in an object)
- `instanceof` (Checks if an object is an instance of a constructor)

## 11. **Spread Operator**
- `...` (Spread operator - expands an iterable object into the list of arguments)

## 12. **Destructuring Assignment**
- `{}` (Object destructuring)
- `[]` (Array destructuring)

## 13. **Optional Chaining Operator**
- `?.` (Optional chaining - allows you to safely access nested properties without causing an error if the property does not exist)

## 14. **Nullish Coalescing Operator**
- `??` (Nullish coalescing - returns the right-hand side operand when the left-hand side is `null` or `undefined`)

## 15. **Exponentiation Operator**
- `**` (Exponentiation - raises the first operand to the power of the second operand)

## 16. **Logical Assignment Operators (ES2021)**
- `&&=` (Logical AND assignment)
- `||=` (Logical OR assignment)
- `??=` (Logical nullish assignment)

## 17. **Pipeline Operator (Experimental)**
- `|>` (Pipeline operator - allows you to chain function calls in a more readable way)

## 18. **BigInt Operators**
- `n` (Suffix for BigInt literals)
- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**` (Arithmetic operations with BigInt)

## 19. **Type Operators**
- `typeof` (Returns the type of a variable)
- `instanceof` (Checks if an object is an instance of a constructor)

## 20. **Grouping Operator**
- `()` (Grouping operator - controls the precedence of evaluation in expressions)

These operators allow you to perform a wide variety of operations in JavaScript, from simple arithmetic to complex logical and bitwise operations.
